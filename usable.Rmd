Pseudocode
#Make ggplot
#Make it a scatterplot with an alpha of .8 to match the graph on 538
#x-axis is final margin election result, y-axis is presidential approval rating
#Add a red smooth line without the confidence background shown
#Add labels to x and y axis
#Set scales on x and y axis to match the graph on 538
#Set title and subtitle
#Print out the entire plot
```
